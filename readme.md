# Introduction

This repository is the ongoing home for maintenance of the conversion
maps between FHIR Releases 2, 3, and 4. 

All the maps are in FHIR version #4 StructureMap and ConceptMap resources.

In addition, the repository contains V2 and (C)CDA conversion routines
for the portable tranformation environment.
